<p>I joined a team of fellow web developers at the Global Game Jam 2018(https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/space-colonies). The theme was &quot;Transmission&quot;. We made a 2‚Äêplayer online game that requires each player to claim as many planets as possible before their opponent does. I developed the code behind that populated and styled the heads-up display, the planet detail mouseover feature and the initial splash page. I also prepared suitable images for our team to use. Go ahead, and give it a try (https://galaxy-control.herokuapp.com/). You and your opponent use a separate browser window.</p>
