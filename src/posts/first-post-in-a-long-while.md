## I'm going to start up blogging again

So I began my journey into Web Development just over a year ago, but I've taken a hiatus from writing posts for my personal site once I was starting out in the industry. Then I became a father so there were a lot of changes and it was a challenging to finally get settled in the job and gain the confidence working in the industry and not in a classroom.

## Still so much to learn

Over the course of this year, I've learned new problem solving strategies, search engine optimization techniques and reporting, web accessibility concepts, developer podcasts, and coding meetups and conferences. All of which I plan to share what I've been learning, here on my blog. One of the best ways to hold on to what I learn is to share and teach someone else or write it down even as notes for myself.

## Going forward

The ultimate goal for this blog is to be a record for myself as well as a how-to resource for people on: Building accessible websites, referencing code examples, Search Engine Optimization, Analytics reporting and of course anything that comes relating to my career change and anecdotes from designer to developer.

**Thanks for reading. Stay tuned for my next post!**
