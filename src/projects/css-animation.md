I was experimenting with CSS animation on this project. At the time, I was inspired by Gal Shir's Responsive House on Dribble(https://dribbble.com/shots/3499449-Responsive-House), and a side project I was working on with Habitat for Humanity, so I set out to make my own version of a CSS house animation. I used LESS to help code the CSS blocks responsible for the animations and some of browser compatibility. JavaScript was used to listen for user interaction and refresh the animation stage.
