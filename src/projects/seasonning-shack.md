The Seasoning Shack is a fictitious restaurant that needed a website to showcase their business. This was a group project, and I created the Event Booking, Location and Home pages. The main focus of this task was to discover JavaScript's versatility and usefulness. My pages include an automated promotion slider, form validation, store hours that update depending on current day and time, an accordion-style image gallery, and a responsive navigation header. I also helped with site design and photo editing of the overall site.
